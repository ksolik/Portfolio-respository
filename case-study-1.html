        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <p>
          I took charge of the entire app design process for a User Experience
          Design course I took at UW-Madison, starting with conducting research
          and competitive analysis to understand the landscape. I then led user
          interviews to gather insights, which helped me prioritize goals and
          shape the direction of the project. From brainstorming ideas to
          designing and testing, I created informed designs, including
          wireframes and both low and high-fidelity prototypes, continuously
          iterating and refining based on feedback throughout the process.

        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <p>
          At Leopold's, a local café that transforms into a bar in the evening,
          customers often face the frustration of waiting in line, especially
          when they’re in a rush or trying to reserve a table for a special
          occasion. This issue impacts both the daytime coffee crowd and the
          evening bar-goers, making the experience less seamless for everyone
          involved.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>
          The Leopold's app is designed to solve these issues by allowing
          customers to pre-order their coffee or food, choose between pickup or
          delivery, and reserve a table in advance. With this app, we aim to
          create a seamless, stress-free experience for both daytime coffee
          lovers and evening bar-goers, making every visit to Leopold's more
          convenient and enjoyable.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>
          Our goal with the Leopold's app is to ensure your café experience is
          as smooth and convenient as possible. You’ll be able to pre-order your
          favorite coffee or food, choose between pickup or delivery, and
          reserve a table at the café, all without the hassle of waiting in
          line. Providing a stress-free and efficient solution for our busy
          customers is our top priority.

        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <p>
          The goal was to understand user needs, pain points, and frustrations
          when ordering from Leopold's. I conducted interviews with six
          participants, revealing issues like unclear menus, delivery delays,
          and limited customization.<br /><br />I also conducted a competitive
          analysis by gathering and auditing screenshots from top competitors,
          focusing on design, navigation, and mobile experience. This helped
          identify best practices and allowed me to design a solution that
          improves Leopold's ordering experience, streamlines navigation, and
          enhances both café and bar functionalities.<br /><br />Insights from
          this research shaped a user-friendly journey, addressing key
          challenges and improving customization, menu clarity, and table
          booking.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Customers dislike long wait times and prefer ordering ahead to avoid
            standing in line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mobile ordering on the go is a top preference, especially for
            customers with busy schedules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users value multiple payment options, including digital wallets like
            Apple Pay and Google Pay.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evening customers appreciate the café-bar transition, but want an
            easy way to order both coffee and drinks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplicity in app navigation is crucial; users want a streamlined

            The usability study for the Leopold’s app involved two rounds of

            for a bottom taskbar with a hamburger menu, easy access to table
            booking, and a consistent bottom menu across all pages. The second
            round, conducted with a high-fidelity prototype, revealed that users
            wanted a way to view available tables and access the cart directly
